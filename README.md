# Functional Java Project

My experiments, try-outs and examples of taking a functional programming approach using Java.

It is dependent on features of Java 8 and later.

## How to run locally

From the project root folder:

- `$ mvn clean package` to build the app.
- `$ java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar cloud.wraith.functional-java.App` to run the app.
- This should print `hello, world` to stdout.

## How to test

- `$ mvn test` to run all unit tests from the command line.
